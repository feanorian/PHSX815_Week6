## integrate.py
Script to calculate numerical integrals using the trapezoidal rule and Gaussian-Legendre quadrature. In this script, a 5th degree polynomial was chosen as the function to integrate.

### Usage:

` python3 integrate.py [-start -end -step -root]`


`-start` lower limit of integral 


`-end`   upper limit of integral 


`-step`  step width for trapezoidal integral 


`-root`  weights/roots for polynomial in Gaussian-Legendre integral
